# Unity ASE Import

## Installation
Copy ASEImporter.cs into your project's `Assets/Plugins` folder

## Usage
Open the `Assets` menu and selecte `Import ASE Palette`. Select your color palette. A new color asset will be created in `Assets/Editor`.

## Capabilities and Restrictions
Color groups will not be copied from the palette as Unity does not allow color groups.
